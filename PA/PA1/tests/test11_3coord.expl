Game: 3x3 Pure Coordination
Payoff structure: Identity matrix × 3

Diagonal: (3, 3) - coordination success
Off-diagonal: (0, 0) - coordination failure

Solution Approach:
In pure coordination games, all diagonal cells are Nash equilibria.

Pure Equilibria:
1. (R1, C1): Both play strategy 1, get (3, 3)
2. (R2, C2): Both play strategy 2, get (3, 3)
3. (R3, C3): Both play strategy 3, get (3, 3)

Each equilibrium is stable - neither player wants to deviate unilaterally
since deviation leads to payoff 0.

Output: 3 pure strategy equilibria on the diagonal
