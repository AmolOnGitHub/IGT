Game: Trivial 1x1 Game
Single outcome: (5, 5)

Solution Approach:
With only one strategy per player, there is no strategic choice.
The unique outcome is trivially a Nash equilibrium since no
alternative strategies exist.

Output: 1 equilibrium (the only possible outcome)
Row: (1.0) - plays only strategy with probability 1
Col: (1.0) - plays only strategy with probability 1

This serves as a boundary case test for the algorithm.
