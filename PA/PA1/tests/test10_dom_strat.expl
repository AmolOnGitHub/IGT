Game: Simple 2x2 with Pure Equilibrium
Payoffs:
(R1, C1) -> (4, 1)
(R1, C2) -> (1, 4)
(R2, C1) -> (2, 2)
(R2, C2) -> (3, 3)

Solution Approach:
Check each cell for Nash equilibrium by verifying best responses.

Pure Equilibrium:
(R2, C2): Payoffs (3, 3)
- Row's best response to C2: max(1, 3) = 3 (R2) ✓
- Col's best response to R2: max(2, 3) = 3 (C2) ✓

Both players coordinate on their second strategy, achieving (3, 3).

Output: 1 pure strategy equilibrium
Row: (0, 1)
Col: (0, 1)
