Game: 2x4 Asymmetric Game
Payoff Matrices:
Row Matrix A:        Col Matrix B:
[5  1  0  2]        [2  3  4  1]
[1  3  4  2]        [5  2  0  3]

Solution Approach:
1. Check 8 cells for pure equilibria - none exist
2. Use Lemke-Howson for mixed equilibrium

Mixed Equilibrium Analysis:
Support on Row {1,2} and Col {1,3}

Let Row play (p, 1-p), Col play (q, 0, 1-q, 0)

For Col indifference between C1 and C3:
E[Col|C1] = 2p + 5(1-p) = 5 - 3p
E[Col|C3] = 4p + 0(1-p) = 4p
Setting equal: 5 - 3p = 4p → p = 5/7 ≈ 0.714286

For Row indifference between R1 and R2:
E[Row|R1] = 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q
E[Row|R2] = 1q + 4(1-q) = 4 - 3q
Setting equal: 5q = 4 - 3q → q = 1/2 = 0.5

Verification: Col never plays C2 or C4 (dominated in this equilibrium)

Output: 1 mixed equilibrium
Row: (0.714286, 0.285714)
Col: (0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)
