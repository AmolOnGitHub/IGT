Game: Zero-Sum (Matching Pennies variant)
Payoffs sum to constant 1 in each cell.

Row Matrix A:        Col Matrix B:
[0  1]              [1  0]
[1  0]              [0  1]

Solution Approach:
1. Check for pure equilibria - none exist in zero-sum games with this structure
2. Find mixed strategy equilibrium using Lemke-Howson

Mixed Equilibrium:
Both players randomize 50-50.

Derivation:
For Row to mix, Col must make Row indifferent:
E[Row|R1] = 0·q + 1·(1-q) = 1-q
E[Row|R2] = 1·q + 0·(1-q) = q
Indifference: 1-q = q → q = 0.5

For Col to mix, Row must make Col indifferent:
E[Col|C1] = 1·p + 0·(1-p) = p
E[Col|C2] = 0·p + 1·(1-p) = 1-p
Indifference: p = 1-p → p = 0.5

Output: 1 mixed equilibrium
Row: (0.5, 0.5)
Col: (0.5, 0.5)
