Game: 3x2 Asymmetric
Payoffs:
Row Matrix A:        Col Matrix B:
[2  3]              [3  2]
[3  2]              [2  1]
[1  5]              [5  6]

Solution Approach:
1. Check all 6 cells for pure Nash equilibria
2. Use Lemke-Howson for mixed strategies if needed

Pure Equilibrium Found:
(R2, C1): Payoffs (3, 2)
- Row's best response to C1: max(2, 3, 1) = 3 (R2) ✓
- Col's best response to R2: max(2, 1) = 2 (C1) ✓

Output: 1 pure strategy equilibrium at (R2, C1)
Row strategy: (0, 1, 0)
Col strategy: (1, 0)
