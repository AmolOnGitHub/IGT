Game: 4x4 Pure Coordination
Payoff structure: 4×4 Identity matrix × 4

Diagonal cells: (4, 4) - successful coordination
Off-diagonal: (0, 0) - coordination failure

Solution Approach:
Extension of coordination game to 4 strategies.
Each diagonal cell is a pure Nash equilibrium.

Pure Equilibria:
1. (R1, C1): Both choose 1 → (4, 4)
2. (R2, C2): Both choose 2 → (4, 4)
3. (R3, C3): Both choose 3 → (4, 4)
4. (R4, C4): Both choose 4 → (4, 4)

All equilibria are equivalent in payoff.
Models situations like choosing among multiple compatible standards.

Output: 4 pure strategy equilibria
