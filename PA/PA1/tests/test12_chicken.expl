Game: Chicken/Anti-coordination variant
Payoffs:
(R1, C1) -> (2, 2)
(R1, C2) -> (0, 3)
(R2, C1) -> (3, 0)
(R2, C2) -> (1, 1)

Solution Approach:
Check for pure strategy Nash equilibria by examining best responses.

Pure Equilibrium Found:
(R2, C2): Payoffs (1, 1)
- Row's best response to C2: max(0, 1) = 1 (R2) ✓
- Col's best response to R2: max(0, 1) = 1 (C2) ✓

Both players choose their second strategy, achieving mutual payoff of 1.

Note: The algorithm finds the pure equilibrium. Mixed equilibria may exist
but are not found in this run.

Output: 1 equilibrium at (R2, C2)
