Game: Matching Pennies (variant)
Payoffs:
(H, H) -> (1, 0)
(H, T) -> (0, 1)
(T, H) -> (0, 1)
(T, T) -> (1, 0)

Solution Approach:
1. Check for pure equilibria - none exist (cyclic preferences)
2. Find mixed strategy equilibrium

Pure Equilibrium Check:
All cells have at least one player wanting to deviate.
This is a zero-sum-like game with conflicting interests.

Mixed Strategy Equilibrium:
Let Row play H with probability p, Col play H with probability q.

For Row to mix (indifferent between H and T):
E[Row|H] = 1·q + 0·(1-q) = q
E[Row|T] = 0·q + 1·(1-q) = 1-q
Indifference: q = 1-q → q = 0.5

For Col to mix (indifferent between H and T):
E[Col|H] = 0·p + 1·(1-p) = 1-p
E[Col|T] = 1·p + 0·(1-p) = p
Indifference: 1-p = p → p = 0.5

Output: 1 mixed equilibrium
Row: (0.5, 0.5) - randomize equally
Col: (0.5, 0.5) - randomize equally
