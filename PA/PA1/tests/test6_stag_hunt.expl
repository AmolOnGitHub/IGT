Game: Anti-coordination variant (2x2)
Payoffs:
(R1, C1) -> (6, 6)
(R1, C2) -> (2, 7)
(R2, C1) -> (7, 2)
(R2, C2) -> (0, 0)

Solution Approach:
1. Check pure strategy Nash equilibria by examining best responses
2. For each cell, verify if both players are playing best responses

Pure Equilibria Found:
- (R1, C2): Row gets 2, Col gets 7
  Row's best response to C2: max(2, 0) = 2 ✓
  Col's best response to R1: max(6, 7) = 7 ✓
  
- (R2, C1): Row gets 7, Col gets 2  
  Row's best response to C1: max(6, 7) = 7 ✓
  Col's best response to R2: max(2, 0) = 2 ✓

Output: 2 pure strategy equilibria
