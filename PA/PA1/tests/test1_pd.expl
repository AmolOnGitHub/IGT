Game: Prisoner's Dilemma
Payoffs:
(Cooperate, Cooperate) -> (3, 3)
(Cooperate, Defect) -> (0, 5)
(Defect, Cooperate) -> (5, 0)
(Defect, Defect) -> (1, 1)

Solution Approach:
Check for dominant strategies, then verify Nash equilibrium.

Dominance Analysis:
Row Player: Strategy 2 (Defect) strictly dominates Strategy 1 (Cooperate)
- If Col cooperates: 5 > 3
- If Col defects: 1 > 0

Column Player: Strategy 2 (Defect) strictly dominates Strategy 1 (Cooperate)
- If Row cooperates: 5 > 3
- If Row defects: 1 > 0

Pure Equilibrium:
(Defect, Defect): Payoffs (1, 1)
- Both players play dominant strategy
- No incentive to deviate unilaterally

This is the classic result: Individual rationality leads to Pareto-inferior outcome.
Both would prefer (3, 3) but end up at (1, 1).

Output: 1 pure strategy equilibrium
Row: (0, 1) - plays Defect
Col: (0, 1) - plays Defect
