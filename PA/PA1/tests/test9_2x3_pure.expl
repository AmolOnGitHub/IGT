Game: 2x3 Asymmetric
Payoffs:
Row Matrix A:        Col Matrix B:
[3  1  2]           [2  3  1]
[2  3  1]           [3  2  3]

Solution Approach:
1. Check all 6 cells for pure equilibria - none exist
2. Apply Lemke-Howson algorithm for mixed strategy equilibrium

Mixed Equilibrium Found:
Row plays: (0.5, 0.5) - equal probability on both strategies
Col plays: (0.667, 0.333, 0) - plays C1 with 2/3, C2 with 1/3, never C3

This is found by solving indifference conditions where:
- Row is indifferent between R1 and R2 given Col's mix
- Col is indifferent between C1 and C2 (and both dominate C3) given Row's mix

Output: 1 mixed strategy equilibrium
