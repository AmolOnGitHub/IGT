Game: Battle of the Sexes
Payoffs:
(Opera, Opera) -> (2, 1)
(Opera, Football) -> (0, 0)
(Football, Opera) -> (0, 0)
(Football, Football) -> (1, 2)

Solution Approach:
Classic coordination game with conflict of interest.

Pure Equilibria:
1. (Opera, Opera): Payoffs (2, 1)
   - Row prefers this coordination point
   - Neither wants to deviate from coordination
   
2. (Football, Football): Payoffs (1, 2)
   - Col prefers this coordination point
   - Neither wants to deviate from coordination

The algorithm finds these two pure equilibria.

Note: A mixed strategy equilibrium also exists theoretically where
Row plays (2/3, 1/3) and Col plays (1/3, 2/3), but the Lemke-Howson
algorithm may not find it depending on starting pivots.

Output: 2 pure strategy equilibria (found by algorithm)
- (Opera, Opera): (1, 0) and (1, 0)
- (Football, Football): (0, 1) and (0, 1)
