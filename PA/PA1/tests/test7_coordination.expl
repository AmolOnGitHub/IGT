Game: Pure Coordination (2x2)
Payoffs:
(R1, C1) -> (1, 1)
(R1, C2) -> (0, 0)
(R2, C1) -> (0, 0)
(R2, C2) -> (1, 1)

Solution Approach:
Classic coordination game where players benefit from matching strategies.

Pure Equilibria:
1. (R1, C1): Both get payoff 1
   - Row's best to C1: max(1, 0) = 1 ✓
   - Col's best to R1: max(1, 0) = 1 ✓

2. (R2, C2): Both get payoff 1
   - Row's best to C2: max(0, 1) = 1 ✓
   - Col's best to R2: max(0, 1) = 1 ✓

Output: 2 pure equilibria (algorithm may not find all mixed equilibria)
